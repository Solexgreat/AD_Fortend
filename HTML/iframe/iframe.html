<!--Note: The iframe will be able to access the parent page's full URL as long as the parent page has the header referrer-policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade. 
    This means that the header referrer will be sent to the iframe with the full parent page's URL because both protocols match.-->

<!--Although integrating the In-Page publishing code can be more complex, using the In-Page code is best when the page containing the player needs to communicate with the player. Some examples of when to use the In-Page embed code include:

The code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events
The player uses styles from the parent page
The iframe code will cause application logic to fail, like a redirect from the parent page
Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe embed code, you can still use the In-Page code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. 
This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.-->
